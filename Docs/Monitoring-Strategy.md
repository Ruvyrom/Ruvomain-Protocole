## Monitoring Strategy


**1. Baseline Consumption (The Point of Origin)**

**Before any modification, you must establish your idle drain.**

>**Action:** Charge your device to 100%. Leave it in deep idle (screenoff, Wi-Fi on, SIM active) for 8 hours (overnight).

>**Measure:** Use AccuBattery.

>**Ruvomain Goal:** Target a drain rate between 0.0% and 0.2% per hour. If you exceed 0.5%, your system is polluted by active telemetry services.

**2. Wakelock Audit (Hunting the Intruders)**

**The primary enemy of battery efficiency is not activeusage; it is the CPU's inability to enter "Deep Sleep."**

>**Tool:** [AppOps](https://appops.rikka.app/) (via [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/)).

**Procedure:**

>**1.Identify** system apps requesting the WAKE_LOCK permission.
>
>**2. Monitor** processes preventing the device from sleeping.
>
>**3.Audit:** If anon-essential system app holds active wakelocks in the background, it must be confined or neutralized according to the Protocol tiers.

**3. Network Traffic Analysis (Data Flow)**

**A sovereign system communicates only when the Architect authorizes it.**

>**Tool:** AdGuard (Filtering Log).

**Procedure:**

>**1.** Enable local filtering.
>
>**2.** Run for 1 hour under normal usage.
>
>**3. Audit:** Observe domains contacted by system apps (Samsung, Google, Facebook services).
>
>**4. Action:** If telemetry domains are detected, apply block rules via theintegrated firewall.

**4. Framework Stability (The Guardrail)**

**Never delete blindly. Verify the health ofthe system_server.**

>**Action:** After applying your configuration (Tier 1/2/3), monitor for spontaneous reboots or UI lag.
>
>**Technical Note:** If the Samsung keyboard reinstalls itself, you have compromised framework dependencies.
>
>**Remember:** Never use brute-force deletion.
Apply the "Confinement Strategy"(revoke permissions + restrict execution) rather than deletion.

**🛡️ Protocol Reminder**

**Your audit success is measured by these indicators:**

>**Thermals:** The device remains at ambient temperature during mixed usage.
>
>**SOT (Screen On Time):** A steady progression toward 11h+ (for an S24+).

>Share your results in the comments:
>
>**Model:** (e.g., S24+ S926B)
>
>**Tier applied:** (Tier 1, 2, or 3)
>
>**Idle drain(mAh/h):**
>
>**System observations:** Audit is repetition. The more you clean, the moretransparent the system becomes.
