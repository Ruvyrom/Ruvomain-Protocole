# Safety & Auditing

The Ruvomain Protocol is designed with security, transparency, and system integrity as its core pillars. This document outlines our approach to ensuring the safety of your deviceand the reliability of our automation scripts.

## Static Analysis (Audit)
To prevent unexpected behaviors and ensure script reliability, all protocol scripts undergo static analysis using **ShellCheck**.

- **Why it matters:** ShellCheck identifies potential bugs, quoting issues, and logical errors in shell scripts before execution.
- **How to run the audit:**
You can verify the integrity of the scripts at any time by running:
`make audit`
This ensures that every line of code complies with POSIX standards and avoids common scripting pitfalls.

## System Integrity(Samsung Knox)
The Ruvomain Protocol is strictly non-destructive. Our approach respects the integrity of your device's security architecture:

1. **Non-Rooted Approach:** We operate solely within the user-space boundaries allowed by ADB. No modificationsare made to system-level partitions or kernels that would trigger a Knox trip (0x1).
2. **Reversibility:** Every package modification performed by the protocol can be reverted using standard ADB commands, ensuring you retain full control over your devicestate.
3. **No Hidden Payloads:** All operations are transparent. You can inspect the source code of every automatedscript before execution to understand exactly what each command does.

## Community & Transparency
We encourage users to audit our scripts. If you find a potential improvement or a security concern, please open an issue on the repository. The security of theRuvomain Protocol relies on the collective vigilance of our community.
